# Create Users and Manage Permissions Using Groups and Policies in IAM

He needs our help with giving this team the proper access permissions. In order to provide access and ensure the proper security measures are in place, you will use AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM). You will group users and assign permissions for the developer group using policies.
